These files of Elman, KRR, SVR and RFR are Elman ANNs, Kernel ridge, Support Vector and Random forest regression, respectively.
Every files contains several formats: Zjn_*.m, Zjn_*_CV.m, Zjn_*_review.m. (e.g. Zjn_SVR.m, Zjn_SVR_CV.m, Zjn_SVR_review.m).
Zjn_*.m and Zjn_*_review.m use DFT&elemental  and elemantal features, respectively. 
Zjn_*_CV.m use Leave-One-Cluster-Out (LOCO) CV method to evalute the prediction.
The more complete script comments exist in ELman code.
